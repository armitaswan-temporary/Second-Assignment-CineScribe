# Project Title

Details on movies, series and Actors aka CineScribe

## Description

A simple program to help you find basic information about movies, series or actors you're looking for

## Project

### Parts And Structures

This program includes three main classes: Main, Movies and Actors
The Main class is for contacting the user which uses a menu and simple commands to communicate and connects with the Movies and Actors classes.
The Movie class is used for receiving information about the searched movie or series using API and JSON and saving the data in more accessible forms for later on, showing it to the user.
The Actors class is exactly the same but the receiving information is about actors or actresses.

### Challenges Throughout The Process

I started this project with absolutely no experience on Java and the JSON stuff, and honestly with a massive amount of fear, laziness and cheerlessness and sorry a whole lotta days after the deadline and my surgery. My whole point is I had no time, no knowledge and no motivation so I had many challenges. I learned anyway. mostly by searching on web and reading other people's experiences and asking. I can't name all the things I didn't know cause it's too many of them I literally didn't know anything. Like how to use the ApI and JSON thing or how to build an object and how exactly that works for us and the little details on getting the data, reading the strings, splitting them and stuff. and I was so tired I didn't really care about the menu, it's fine as long as it works. I hope it works.
